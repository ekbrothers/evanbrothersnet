intro: |
  Quantifying the impact of volunteers to a nonprofit can be a complex task.

  iPad and accessible on any connected device at any time by volunteers, allows volunteers to check-in, check-out, and add hours that they worked.  In addition, it records data on what the volunteer was doing, and collects timestamps for their work. 

  Information collected by the system can also be used to collect feedback from volunteers in evaluating their experience. Having this information allows an organization like the Farm the opportunity to be responsive and adaptive to volunteer availability and interests.
