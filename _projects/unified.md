intro: |
  During evenings in my rural Zambian community, drawing power from a solar-powered car battery, I built a mobile malaria survey hosted on AWS for use with Open Data Kit, an open-source app used by the WHO, CDC, USAID, Red Cross and Red Crescent, and the Carter Center. This survey incorporated conditional-logic to ensure survey questions were concise and targeted, and implemented GPS to record the location of survey entries. In using mobile phones and cellular data networks, manual data entry was not necessary, and analysis of the raw data could be done on the cloud directly.

          The design system was set out with rules to ensure the icons
          could be used in a wide range of circumstances â€” like for different
          cultures, at small sizes and with and without labels.
